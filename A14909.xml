            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29041:3"/> 
                     <hi>Joſhua</hi> who brought them to their reſt. So there are three guides which direct men in this world; firſt corrupt nature, or <hi>natura non ſuſcitata,</hi> that is, nature not wakened or ſtirred up by learning; this guide is but like unto <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> and oftentimes it murmureth againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> the law of God. The ſecond guide is <hi>ratio ſuſcitata,</hi> reaſon wakned and ſtirred up, and ſomewhat refined by learning and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſciences; yet it is but a blinde guide, and oftentimes it murmureth, and repineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes</hi> as well as leprous <hi>Miriam.</hi> The third guide which directeth men here; is the law of God, which ſheweth us the way to Canaan and our eternall reſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Iewes three manner of wayes; firſt by the ceremonies; ſecondly by the Iudiciall; and thirdly by the Morall precepts. The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies did dilineate to them Chriſt to come, and as a painter when hee is about to paint a man, firſt hee draweth ſome lines and draughts, and this is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; Secondly hee addeth the blacke colours, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and laſtly the vive colours, and this is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; then we diſcerne plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whom hee did delineate before: wee take up at the firſt that hee is painting a man, but
<pb facs="tcp:29041:3"/> wee cannot diſcerne in particular who it is: The firſt lineaments (as it were) of Chriſt were drawne to the Patriarches; then <hi>Moſes</hi> added the blacke colours in the ceremonies; but when Chriſt came in the fleſh, then hee was ſeene in his vive colours: and as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, to the Patriarches hee was <hi>in ſpicis,</hi> to the Iewes <hi>in farina, ſed nobis in pane;</hi> that is, the Patriarches ſaw him as it were, but in the eare of the corne, the Iewes ſaw him in the meale, but we ſee him in the bread ſet upon the table before us. The ſecond way how <hi>Moſes</hi> directed them, was by his judiciall lawes, guiding them in their policie and commonwealth, where for hardneſſe of their hearts, hee permitted many things to them; but their chiefe and principall guide was the Morall law, which is that guide of guides. <hi>David</hi> when hee breaketh out in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this law, hee ſpendeth the whole 119 pſalme in praiſe of it, and there is not one verſe in it except the 122 which hath not ſome epithet of the law of God in it, as his judgements, his words, his lawes, his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, his commandements, his covenant, his ſtatutes, and his precepts &amp;c. It may be ſaid, perhaps, that this law ſeemeth not to be
<pb facs="tcp:29041:4"/> ſuch a guide, ſeing it is called a killing letter, and the miniſtration of death: but this is only accidentall to it that it is ſo called,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.6.7.</note> when it meeteth with the perverſe and corrupt nature of unregenerate man, then it is the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death and a killing letter; but when it meeeteth with a regenerate man, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a guide unto him; therefore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay well, <hi>Datur duris in flagellum, profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus in paedagogiam, &amp; perfectioribus in ſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> the law is a whip and a ſcourge to the ſtubborne and diſobedient, it is a tutor to thoſe who begin to learne new obedience, but it becometh a comforter and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller to thoſe who have made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in holineſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.26.</note> and as God himſelfe with the pure hee will ſhew himſelfe pure; and with the froward hee will ſhew himſelfe froward, ſo doth this law ſhew it ſelfe a hard and a rigorous Taskmaſter to the wicked. This law being ſuch a perfect guide, and ſo neceſſary in the Church, what monſters are theſe <hi>Antinomians</hi> who ſet themſelves againſt the law, and will baniſh it out of the Church, whereas Chriſt came not to deſtroy the law but to fulfill it Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> were in the mountaine together:<note place="margin">Matt. 5.17. Matt. 17.3.</note> ſo the Church ſang the
<pb facs="tcp:29041:4"/> ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſong of the lambe,<note place="margin">Revel. 15.3.</note> the Law and the Goſpell muſt not be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thoſe who would remove and baniſh the law out of the Church doe as theeves do when they come to robbe and ſteale; the firſt thing that that they doe in the houſe, they put out the light that they may ſteale the more ſecurely: So carnall and profane men, that they may ſinne the more ſecurely and with greater liberty, doe labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the law out of the Church; but the Lord never lighted his candle, that it ſhould be put under a buſhell. The Lord hath ſet men in three ranks in the world: ſome in the meaneſt and baſeſt condition of life, ſome in a middle condition of life, and ſome in a higher condition: this law is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all ſorts and conditions of men: for to thoſe who live in the loweſt and baſeſt condition it is neceſſary to uphold them, they have not beene unfitly compared to a fiſhers net, which hath lead to make it ſinke, and corke to make it ſwimme; ſo poverty and croſſes hold the poore man down and make him to ſinke, then the comfortable promiſes of the law of God make him to ſwimme and hold up his head: ſo this law is neceſſary for
<pb facs="tcp:29041:5"/> thoſe who are in a middle ſtate, it is like the tongue of the ballance to thoſe to make the ſcales ſtand right, but it is moſt of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thoſe who ſtand in high places, for high places, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, are ſlippery places. In Iſrael when a man built a new houſe he was commanded to make a battlement about it,<note place="margin">Deut. 22.8.</note> leſt men ſhould fall over and indanger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo when men are in eminent places, the beſt battlement to ſave them is the law of God. I know, my Honorable, and very good Lord, when yee remember Gods goodneſſe towards you who hath advanced you to ſuch an high place, and continued you in ſuch favour with your Prince ſo long, that ye will be thankfull to your God, and that ye will not forget to make this law your philactery,<note place="margin">Prov. 3.3.</note> and put it like a chain about your necke. The reaſons, my Honorable Lord, that have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to ſeeke your Lordſhips patrocinie to this worke, are firſt, becauſe I know ye love the truth. Secondly, becauſe ye have ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and honourably carried your ſelfe often in thoſe weighty imployments which his Majeſty and the State have committed to you. And thirdly, becauſe you carry your ſelfe ſo reſpectively to all ſorts of men at home: theſe
<pb facs="tcp:29041:5"/> motives encouraged mee to take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to preſent this treatiſe to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And although I be not able to bring a lambe, the ſacrifice of the richer ſort, yet if I bring but two turtle doves,<note place="margin">Levit. 5.7.</note> I know your Lordſhip will accept of it, becauſe a man is debter for that which he hath,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12.</note> and not for that which he hath not. The grace of God be with your Lordſhip, and preſerve you blameleſſe in ſoule and body untill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord in glory.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt the Law Morall and Iudiciall.</note>To ſhew the excellencie of the Morall Law, above all other Lawes; let us compare, firſt, Gods Morall Law, with his judiciall Law which hee gave alſo himſelfe. Gods morall Law exceedeth his judiciall Law in this, that his judiciall Law obliged the Iewes, and that onely in <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Iudiciall law did binde the Iewes onely in <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                        </note> As other poſitive Lawes binde, not men out of their owne Countrie; ſo the judiciall Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> obliged not the Iewes; but onely in Iudea. Example, no Levite might have a poſſeſſion in Iudea particularly by himſelfe; yet their Law did not binde the Iewes out of <hi>Iudea;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Morall Law bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all perſons in all places.</note> for a Levite of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſold his poſſeſſion, and laid the mony downe at the Apoſtles feete. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.36. but Gods morall Law bindeth all perſons, in all places an therefore it is called <hi>the royall Law,</hi> or the Kings Law, <hi>Iames,</hi> 2.8. For that which the King commandeth to be common, is common to all; as the Kings high way, <hi>Num.</hi> 21.2. So the Kings weight. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.26. <hi>He weighed the haire of his head at two hundred ſicles after the Kings weight;</hi> That is, the weight wherewith all men weighed. So the Kings Law, that is, the Law which all are bound to walke in. Contrary to this, is <hi>perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere vias domini, to pervert the wayes of the Lord. Act.</hi> 10.13. It was a great blindeneſſe then of thoſe, who ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 16.21. that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas taught cuſtomes which were not lawfull for them to receive, neither to obſerve being Romans.</hi> But Gods morall Law bindeth all people a like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Morall law bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the inner man, but the Iudiciall Law bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him not.</note>Secondly, the morall Law bindeth the inner man, but the judiciall Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> obliged not the inner man. Example, <hi>Tooth for tooth, and eye for eye, Deut.</hi> 16.21. When one had paid tooth for tooth, or eye for eye, hee had ſatisfied the judiciall Law; for that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no more of him. but the morall Law required
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29041:17"/> more of him, that hee ſhould bee free of the rancour of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The iudiciall Law was fitted for them, as they were a people of a hard heart; as the law of divorce,<note place="margin">The Iudiciall Law for the eſtate of the Iewes.</note> of Ielouſie, and of the revenger of the blood; which were Lawes made according to the hardneſſe of the hearts of that people; and as the ſhoomaker maketh a ſhooe according to the crooked foote: ſo the Lord made theſe iudiciall Lawes, and fitted them to the eſtate of that people. <hi>Solon</hi> being asked, whether he had given the beſt Lawes to the <hi>Athenians</hi> or not? Anſwered: the beſt that they could ſuffer. So the Lord fitted theſe Lawes to the nature of that people: but the morall Law of God, is not fitted that way to the eſtate of men; but all men muſt fit themſelves to it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, ſome of the Iudiciall Lawes exempted ſome men, from performing ſome duties;<note place="margin">The Iudiciall Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted ſome men from ſome duties, but the morall Law bindeth all alike.</note> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 24, 5. A mad ſhould not goe to the warres, nor bee charged with any buſineſſe, the firſt yeare that hee is married. But the morall Law preſcribeth alike obedience to all, <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2, 16. <hi>Let the bridegroome goe forth of his chamber and the bride out of her cloſet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us compare Gods morall Law,<note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt the morall Law and the ceremoniall.</note> and his ceremoniall Law together. Some of the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Lawes obliged all the Iewes in all places: therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> might not eate of any of the uncleane meates of the King of <hi>Babel, Dan.</hi> 1, 8. Some of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies obliged but ſome of the Iewes in all places;<note place="margin">Ceremonies which had relati n to the Temple, were not kept in the Wilderneſſe, or in the captivity.</note> as no Nazaret might drinke wine. And thirdly ſome of the ceremonies, obliged all the Iewes at ſometimes; as no Iew might eat leaven at the <hi>Paſcha.</hi> But the morall Law obliged all people, at all times, and in all places. Theſe ceremonies which had relation to the Temple, they kept them neither in the wilderneſſe, nor in the captivitie: as they paid nothing to the Prieſts who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29041:18"/> in the Temple. But the morall Law did bind them, both in the wilderneſſe and in the captivitie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who brake the Sabbath in the wilderneſſe, was ſtoned to death, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the ceremoniall Law was accommodated and fitted to them, as they were infants in the Church; and it was fitted to their capacity and non-age: but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law bindeth all eſtates and conditions of men alike.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ceremoniall Law ſhew what was ſinne <hi>ex accidente</hi> indirectly, but the morall <hi>per ſe</hi> and directly.</note>Thirdly, the ceremoniall Law, made them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſinne, <hi>ex accidente;</hi> for it was appointed <hi>in expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem peccati,</hi> for the expiation of ſinne: as the judiciall Law was appointed <hi>in paenam peccati,</hi> for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne. But the morall Law ſhewed them directly what was ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, theſe ceremoniall Lawes are called, <hi>praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta non bona, Ezekiel.</hi> 20.25. <hi>I gave them alſo ſtatutes that were not good, and judgements whereby they ſhall not live.</hi>

And he that kept them could not live by them; they were given but as hedges to keepe in the people,<note place="margin">The ceremoniall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were called, <hi>not good,</hi> becauſe they brought nothing to perfection.</note> after they ſet up the Golden Calfe, that they ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatrie any more: and they were <hi>but ſhadowes to them, of good things to come, Heb.</hi> 10.1. They comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neither vertue nor vice in themſelves; therefore he calleth them <hi>praecepta non bona.</hi> But the morall Precepts are juſt and holy, <hi>and the man that doth them, ſhall live in them, Gal.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt the morall Law, and the Lawes of men.</note>Thirdly, let us compare Gods morall Law and the Lawes of men, they ſay that <hi>ratio legis eſt anima legis,</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29041:18"/> the wiſdome of God was <hi>anima huius legis,</hi> and as farre as the wiſedome of God, differed from the wiſedome of man; ſo farre differeth the Law of God, from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Lawes of men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the civill Law ſaith,<note place="margin">The morall Law of God forbiddeth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent, but the Law of man doth not ſo.</note> 
                        <hi>de minutis non curat lex,</hi> that is, the Law looketh not to every ſmall tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But Gods morall Law, obſerveth and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, both the great and the leaſt ſinnes; it forbiddeth Gnats, as well as Camels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. The <hi>Nazaret</hi> was forbidden as well to eat the kernell of the Raiſin, as to eate the huske, or drinke the Wine. <hi>Num.</hi> 6.4. So the Lord forbiddeth in his Law, as well the firſt motions of the heart without conſent, as he doth the act it ſelfe; but mans Law looketh not to theſe:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and as the Sunne when it ſhineth brightly, ſheweth us <hi>atomes,</hi> the very little motes, which are the leaſt things we can perceive: ſo the bright Law of God, ſheweth us theſe firſt motions of the heart to be ſinne, which the naturall man would thinke to be as ſmall as the motes in the Sunne.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The King wrote out Deuteronomie onely.</note> rather then any other part of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, was this; becauſe it is a compend of the whole Law, and all theſe things commanded to them concerning the King, are ſet downe in it: in the other bookes, there are many hiſtories and things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Prieſts, and belong not to the King: therefore he wrote them not out.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Some erre in dividing the Commandements.</note> Here it is expreſsly ſayd, that there are ten Commandements; but men have erred ſundry wayes in dividing theſe Commandements: for ſome of the Iewes make the firſt and ſecond but one Commandement; yet to make up the number of ten, they made this the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I am the Lord thy God &amp;c.</hi> and they ſay, this muſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29041:26"/> of neceſſity be preſuppoſed, To beleeve that there is a God who commandeth; and they hold, that in this Commandement the Lord bindeth them To beleeve in him. They cleare the matter by this compariſon. If a King ſhould come to a people whom they know not, and hee were to give them Lawes, it were neceſſarie firſt that they ſhould know him to be a King; and what right hee had over them to give them Lawes: So when God ſayeth <hi>I am the Lord your God,</hi> it is as much as if hee ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">The Iſraelites beleeved in God before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Law.</note> receive me for your King and ſubmit you to my Lawes. But this ſhould not induce us to thinke, that theſe words are a command: for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> before they came to receive the Law, they beleeved in him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.31. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. after that they had paſſed the red ſea, <hi>They beleeved in God and in Moſes.</hi> They believed in God already, and therefore they needed not a new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to be given them that they ſhould believe, but that was preſuppoſed: for if they had not firſt beleeved, he ſhould not have given them theſe Lawes: and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that when hee was about to give them the Law, that all things the Lord would bid them doe, that they would do <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.8.

                           <note place="margin">Adoratio relativa, quid.</note> when it endeth not in the creature, <hi>Sed tranſit in aliud,</hi> it paſſeth to another; and this ſort of worſhip is forbidden in the ſecond Commandement: ſuch was the worſhip which <hi>Cornelius</hi> would have given to <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 10.25. and which <hi>Iohn</hi> would have given to the Angell <hi>Revela.</hi> 19.10.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, others diſtinguiſh the firſt and the ſecond Commandement this way:<note place="margin">Neither all, nor onely inward worſhip, is commanded in the firſt Table.</note> that all inward worſhip is commanded in the firſt Commandement, and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, in the ſecond but neither all, nor onely, inward worſhip is commanded in the firſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: as to bow the knee before God <hi>terminative et abſolute,</hi> is judged a part of the worſhipe of God in the firſt Commandement: ſo both the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward relative worſhip are condemned in the ſecond Commandement. When a man carrieth any religious and reverent reſpect to worſhip before the creature, this is condemned in the ſecond Commandement, as when the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> would not tread upon the threſhold where Dagon broake his necke 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly when falſe worſhip is given to the falſe God, they make that a breach of the ſecond Commandement; and when true worſhip is given to the true God, they ſay this is commanded in the firſt Commandment: but this diſtinction holdeth not, for when a man worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a falſe God, by falſe meanes; as when a Covetous man maketh a God of his mony, it is a breach of the firſt Commandement, and not of the ſecond: but when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29041:31"/> he goeth about to worſhip: any creature for Gods cauſe outwardly in act, this relative worſhip is condemned in the ſecond Commandement.</p>

                        <p>The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> propounded a queſtion to the Prieſts. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.12. <hi>If one beare holy fleſh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt doth touch bread or pottage, or wine, or oyle, or any meat, ſhall it be holy? and the Prieſts anſwered and ſaid, no?

No: if an uncleane thing touch a cleane thing, will it make it uncleane? Yes: but here when the altar touched the gift, it ſanctified it more, and made it holy. And here is the difference betwixt legall ſanctification &amp; Chriſts blood purging us; for Chriſts blood when it toucheth us, it maketh us holy, but it becometh not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, whereas theſe things which were holy under the

                        <p>In this <hi>promiſe</hi> a deſire is not ſufficient to make a vow,<note place="margin">What is ſufficient to make a vow.</note> neither is the purpoſe or intention ſufficient to make it, unleſſe hee who voweth have a minde to oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; it ſufficeth to make a vow, if hee hath reſolved in his minde although hee hath neither ſpoken it by word or writ.</p>

                        <p>There are ſome vowes <hi>de malo &amp; ad malum;</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Things that are not in our power.</note>So he may not vow that which is not in his power: Example, a man that is married may not vow abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from his wife,<note place="margin">Things abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> nor the woman from her husband; the reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the man hath not power over his body, but the wife; neither hath the woman power over her owne body,</hi>

So abſtinence from leaven, was but a ceremoniall law, becauſe it was forbidden only at the Paſcha, and not at the reſt of the feaſts; but to buy and ſell is forbidden in all their three feaſts: therefore it is a morall precept, they might buy nothing upon the day of the Paſſover, therefore they bought all neceſſaries the day before. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.27. So that which is forbidden to ſome perſons and not to all is a ceremoniall thing. Example, no <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret</hi> might drinke wine, and the Prieſt might not drinke wine when he entred into the Congregation, but other perſons might drinke wine, therefore it is but a ceremoniall law.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ALOMON the wiſeſt King, writ three ſeveral books, and in thoſe three ſeverall books he taketh three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Epithetes and Stiles unto himſelfe: in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbes</hi> he calleth himſelfe <hi>Salomon</hi> the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Jſrael;</hi> In <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> he calleth himſelfe the Preacher, ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> And in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> he calleth himſelfe <hi>Salomon</hi> onely. In the firſt booke he giveth directions to
<pb facs="tcp:29041:145"/> all men, and as a King hee ſpeaketh to all; in his ſecond booke, he as a Preacher ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> below here, he ſpeaketh not to all here as King of <hi>Jſrael;</hi> In his third booke, he ſpeaketh onely to the Church above. So the Lord when hee giveth his Lawes, he giveth ſome Lawes to all, as King of the Nations, and ſome Lawes he giveth to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> his peculiar people, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel he giveth as to the Church above; the law which he gave to all Nations, was the law of Nature manifeſted to <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, and this Law was repeated againe to <hi>Noah</hi> in ſeven Preceps, as not to commit Idolatry, Fornication, to abſtaine from things ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:29041:145"/> not written in your Law, becauſe this Law was directed to them after a ſpeciall manner, and therefore they are called his people, hee came to his owne,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.11.</note> and his owne knew him not. Theſe ceremoniall Lawes did not binde other people, as they did the <hi>Jewes;</hi> therefore when <hi>Jonah</hi> came and preached to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> he ſpake nothing to them of the ceremonies of the Law; ſo when <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpake to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> he ſpake nothing of the ceremoniall Law. So when <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſpake to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> he ſpake not a word of this Law to him. So when the Prophets ſpake to <hi>Tyrus, Sydon,</hi> and to the Nations round about, they ſpake nothing of thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to them, theſe belonged only to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they are forbidden to eate things ſtrangled, or a beaſt that dyed of it ſelfe, but yet the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> might eate of ſuch.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> And here we may marke a difference betwixt circumciſion and the reſt of the ceremonies of the Law, for many that were not of the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> uſed circumciſion, as <hi>Herodotus Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtifie, for circumciſion was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity, not onely to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity who lived within the Church, but to thoſe alſo who came of <hi>Jſmael, Eſau, Keturah, &amp;c.</hi> and howſoever
<pb facs="tcp:29041:146"/> thoſe did circumciſe rather by imitation, than for conſcience, yet it was a law given to all <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie; but the reſt of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies did no wayes binde them; but the morall part of this Law bindeth them all. It was a great mercy of God, that when man had fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that he giveth him a Law againe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.6.</note> and doth not ſuffer him to wander as a Lambe in a large paſture, and like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed Heifer which knoweth not the Yoke, and that one ſhould not devour another,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.15.</note> as the Fiſhes of the Sea, but giveth him a Law to hedge him in, and keepe him within the bounds. Man hath a threefold life, his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, his naturall life, and his civill life; the Lord in his Law had regard to all theſe ſorts of lives; firſt, his ſpirituall life, which is called the life of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.</note> and hee taketh order with this in the firſt Table; Secondly, his naturall life, that he be not killed, nor his blood ſhed; and thirdly, for his civill life, that he may have the meanes to live comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Marc.</hi> 5.26.</note> which is called a mans life, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Other Lawes of Men are but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning circumſtances, and they are but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Law, to this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar people, and they ſtand not unmoveable, as this Law of God doth, but upon occaſions
<pb facs="tcp:29041:146"/> they may be altered and changed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Perſians</hi> that made their Lawes which could not be changed, incroached too farre upon the LORD and his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and all other Lawes are to be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this Law, and the farther that they goe from this, they are the more imperfect; Men ſet the Dyall by the Sunne, and their Watch by the Dyall, The Dyall commeth neerer to the Sunne than the Watch; ſo when men reduce their Lawes to this Law, then they ſet the Dyall to the Sunne, but when they rectifie their Lawes by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law, they ſet but their Watch to their Dyall. Many have written already upon thoſe Commandements, to whom we are much beholden, and the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> Proverbe is true of them, <hi>niſi ipſi elevaſſent lapidem non inventa fuiſſet ſub eo haec Margarita,</hi> but yet there is ſomething left to be cleared, and as there was oyle enough ſo long as there were Veſſels in the Widdowes houſe; So there ſhall be matter enough for all thoſe who are to intreate of this Subject: and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention eſpecially is here to cleare theſe things out of the phraſe of the Originall Tongues, and the cuſtomes of the people of God, and although there be things handled already
<pb facs="tcp:29041:147"/> by others ſet downe here, yet when yee find theſe things, count them not as <hi>vrticam inter myrtos,</hi> but as <hi>myrta inter myrtos,</hi> for both come from him, who is the Authour of Truth.</p>
                  <p>It may pleaſe your Lordſhip to accept of theſe my Travels, as a ſignification of the honourable reſpect I carry to your Lordſhip, whoſe vertue and learning hath brought you to this eminent place. <hi>Laertius</hi> writeth of one <hi>Crates,</hi> that beſtowed his gifts very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly; for he gave to his Flatterer tenne Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, to his Whore a Talent, to his Cooke ten <hi>Mnas,</hi> to his Phyſitian a Drachme, to his Philoſopher three halfe pennies, to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>fumum,</hi> ſmoake; fooliſh men value the baſeſt things at the higheſt rate, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things at the baſeſt rate; But I know, my Lord, that you weigh things in the balance of the Sanctuary, and thinke more of thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, than of thoſe baſe and ſinfull pleaſures, which the world are ſo much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with; The grace of God be with your Lordſhip, and keepe and preſerve you for ever.</p>

                        <p>THe Iewes ſay that in <hi>Iſrael</hi> there was a mutuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and tranſmiſſion of the inheritance;<note place="margin">Maimonides de primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitura.</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there was tranſmiſſion, but not a ſucceſſion, and thirdly, that there was ſucceſſion, but not a tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and fourthly, that there was neither tranſmiſſion, nor ſucceſſion.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, there was a mutuall ſucceſſion betwixt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſonne, when the child ſucceeded to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if his ſon died without children, he tranſmitted the inheritance back to his father again, although he were dead; and then the inheritance deſcended to the next brethren from the father, and ſo to the daughters if there were no brethren; and they ſucceeded not here as brothers to their brother who was dead, but as children to their father, as if he had beene alive; and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was tranſmitted upward, although it were even to <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore the Iewes ſay, that no man wanted an heire in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the inheritance was tranſmitted, but there was no mutuall ſucceſſion. Example, the woman might tranſmit to her husband all which were hers, but ſhee could not ſucceed to her husband.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, there was a ſucceſſion but not a tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the ſonne ſucceeded to his mother, but he could
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29041:181"/> not tranſmit his right to her.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, there was neither ſucceſſion nor tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as theſe who were <hi>uterini,</hi> borne of one mother, but not begotten of one father; they did neither ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to their brethren, nor yet was there any tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>The inheritance deſcended to the males, and if they had no males, then it came to the daughters; and if the child was an Hermaphrodite,<note place="margin">If there were no males to ſucceed, then the daughters ſucceeded.</note> of whom they doubted whether hee was male or female, then the inheritance fell not to this Hermaphrodite, but hee was reckoned amongſt the daughters onely, and got his portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>

The reaſon why the Lord would have them ready to teſtifie,<note place="margin">Why the Lord would have preſent witneſſes, when the Miniſters or Elders are accuſed.</note> was this; the Lord hath a great care and reſpect to his Goſpell, and hath put this treaſure in earthly veſſels; firſt, hee will have no man to touch them, or do them any harme, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 105.15. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee will have maintenance given to them, that they may be incouraged in the law of the Lord, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.4. Thirdly, hee hath a great care of their credit and good name, for if the accuſation were not followed preſently, then the Elder all this time lay under the ſlander, and the accuſer was, the conquerer; <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.4. ſaith, <hi>That thou maiſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt,</hi>

                        <p>And there is great neceſſity why the Lord ſhould have ſuch a care of the miniſter, for it hath beene ſtill the policy of the devill to blot their good name. See
